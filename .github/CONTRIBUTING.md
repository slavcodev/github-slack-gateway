# Contributing guide

The contribution is accepted via Pull Requests

## Pull Requests

- **Follow the conventions used in the project.**

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
    Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch, create branch, e.g. `feature-name` or `bugfix-title`.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests. Use appropriate labels.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
    If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
    Please read [How to write a good Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
